**SEIR_Model_For_COVID-19_Pandemic**

Following the appearance of the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China,
there are currently 21,026,758 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 755,786 deaths,
reported to WHO as on 15 August 2020. With the alarming spread of the disease it is
essential to device an epidemiological model to trace the future course of the pandemic and
accordingly take necessary steps to stop the spread of the disease.

For the above mentioned purpose, we make use of the SEIR Model to analyse the scenario. In the SEIR Model, the
population is divided into four non-overlapping subpopulations based on the stage of the
disease namely as Susceptible(S), Exposed (E), Infected (I) and Recovered (R). It is
important to note that demographic changes like birth, death, etc are not taken into account
and the total population is assumed to remain constant through the course of study. The
differential equations formulated may be solved in python with the help of Kantor’s Code and
a plot of S, E, I, R can be used to make meaningful conclusions. Also, SEIR Model gives us
the freedom to study the effects of social distancing on the pandemic with the introduction of
‘µ’ parameter. It is possible to illustrate how adaption of public health interventions like
social distancing can help reduce the fraction of infected population by decreasing the
infection rate.

The SEIR Model may be implemented to a hypothetical IIT Ropar Campus of 2,000 students
to obtain similar results.
